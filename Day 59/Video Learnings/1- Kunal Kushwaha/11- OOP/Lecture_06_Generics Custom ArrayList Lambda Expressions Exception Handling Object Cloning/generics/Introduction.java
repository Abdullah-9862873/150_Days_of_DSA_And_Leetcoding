_______________________________NOTES_______________________________
---> Generics is a way of creating reusable code that can be used by various kinds of objects without having to create seperate code for that objects to be used...

ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList();          // Integer type list
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList();           // String type list


So these <Integer> <String> are generics that allow us to reuse the same code of ArrayList with different classes such as here "Integer" class and "String" class... Generics accepts only "classes" as parameter...


__________________________BENEFITS  OF GENERICS_________________________
--->Type safety: Generics specifies which data type is allowed resultantly providing a type safety that only the type allowed should get used...
---> Reusability: Generics provide a template so you can have the same code used for String type for Integer type... Without having to create seperate classes for them...
