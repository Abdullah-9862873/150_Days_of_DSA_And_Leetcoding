_________________________What are Collection Frameworks?_________________________
---> There were alot of data structures and some of them have some methods in common but as the data structures were different so the interfaces or the classes made for them were all different and the methods were declared seperately inside each of them... As there was no source of template where they can get those methods and have their own implementation so collection framework was created which helps in providing a template with some common methods that the individual classes or whatever of data structures can extend or implement for their own use...

---> For Example, List is an interface that extends Collection interface... Collection interface has some methods like "get" "size" "remove" etc that the list can use and override and define for its own use...

________________________Uses of Collection Frameworks?__________________________
---> Collections are made optimized so this ensures that common operations like searching and sorting are as fast as possible.
---> Collections can work together seamlessly, allowing you to use different types of collections in a consistent manner. For example, you can easily convert a list to a set or vice versa.
