/*
-----------------When to Use??-----------------
----> When answer lies near the root node
----> When you are asked to search by level

-----------------Example-----------------
----> Calculate the sum of nodes in binary search tree of each level

                                        1
                                       /  \
                                      2    3

                                    4  5  6  7

BFS will be like 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
