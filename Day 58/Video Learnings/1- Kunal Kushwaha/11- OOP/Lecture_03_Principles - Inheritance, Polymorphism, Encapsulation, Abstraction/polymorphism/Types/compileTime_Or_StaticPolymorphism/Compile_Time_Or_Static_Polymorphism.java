_______________________How its achieved?_______________________
----> Achieved via Method Overloading.... Method overloading means, same name of methods but different types, arguments, return types, position of aruguments. example, multiple constructors 

__________________Why is it called compile time polymorphism?__________________
----> This is because which method is going to run is decided on compile time... Memory allocations are done in runtime but checking which method to run is actually done during compile time...
