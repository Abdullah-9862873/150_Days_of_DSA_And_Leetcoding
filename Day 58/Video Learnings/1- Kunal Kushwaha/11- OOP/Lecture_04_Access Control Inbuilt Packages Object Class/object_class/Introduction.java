______________________What are object classes?___________________
----> Object class is a class that is present inside the "lang" package... It is by default extended by every class... 
----> But as we know that java does not support multiple inheritance then how come a class lets say "A" is extending class "B" and an "object" class... This is an exceptional case as every class is by default extending "object" class in java

So its doing internally something like:
class A extends object, B{

}

----> The Object class defines the basic state and behavior that all objects must have, such as the ability to compare oneself to another object, to convert to a string, to wait on a condition variable, to notify other objects that a condition variable has changed, and to return the object's class.
