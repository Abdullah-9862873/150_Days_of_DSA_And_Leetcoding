_______________________________NOTES_______________________________
----> Hybrid inheritance is a mixture of hierarchical and multiple inheritance.... And since multiple inheritance is not allowed in java so hybrid is also not allowed...

----> Following is the demonstration of it:

                                A
                         ← ← ←  ↓ → → →
                        ↓               ↓
                        B               C
                        ↓               ↓
                        → → →   D   ← ← ←

But this can be done using Inheritance...
