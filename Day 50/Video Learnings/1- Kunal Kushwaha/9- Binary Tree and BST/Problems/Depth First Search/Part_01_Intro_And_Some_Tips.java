----> In a binary search tree, If you get something like find lowest number or lesser number than node or some question like that then you can use the inOrder traversal of BST because that includes the Left-Node-Right traversal technique... So it will print the left most first and the left most is the smallest...

----> When you are dealing with deleting the tree... Then you can use PostOrder because it includes dealing with the root node at the last... Left-Right-Node

----> Depth first search, an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it.
